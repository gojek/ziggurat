# Change Log

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. This change log follows the conventions of [keepachangelog.com](http://keepachangelog.com/).

## Unreleased Changes

## 3.6.2
- Validation of stream and batch route arguments against the configuration, when starting the application.

## 3.6.1
- Changed the logic for committing offsets to only commit only when non-zero records are polled while 
consuming via Kafka Consumer API

## 3.6.0
- Error reporting done to newrelic along with sentry.

## 3.5.3
- Refactored and simplified the code for retrying, publishing and consuming using RabbitMQ.
- The config `{:messaging {:constructor` has been removed from `:ziggurat` config space
- Both, `{:ziggurat :rabbit-mq-connection {:hosts`  and `{:ziggurat :rabbit-mq-connection {:host` configs 
are accepted for connecting to RabbitMQ. But, `:hosts` is preferred over `:host`. `:hosts` should be used
to define cluster hosts.
- defrecord `ziggurat.mapper.MessagePayload` has been added back to preserve backward compatibility
- Fixed a bug in calculation of exponential backoff timeout where casting the timeout to integer 
was throwing an IllegalArgumentException  

## 3.5.2
- If there's an exception in the batch handler function, the failure metrics is published with a count of "total batch 
size" (which was being processed by the function) instead of just 1 as was being done before this change. 

## 3.5.1
- Fixed publishing of metrics for batch consumption
- Fixed the startup logic for batch consumption - only routes provided in Ziggurat init-args will be started
- Standardized naming for Kafka Consumer API configs

## 3.5.0

- Adds support for consuming Kafka messages in batches using Kafka Consumer API
- Fixes the logic during RabbitMQ disconnection - Ziggurat now retries (publishing a message) 
infinitely till RMQ recovers. This changes the present behaviour where Kafka Streams were being stopped
during disconnection with RabbitMQ.
